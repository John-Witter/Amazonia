## Primary Components

### User Authorization
User authorization is handled in JavaScript using BCrypt for password hashing. These hashed passwords are saved to the database instead of the plain-text passwords. Upon login, the password that a user enters is rehashed and checked against the hashed password in the database to verify credentials.
